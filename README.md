# Principal R&D Engineer & System Architect - Competitive Advantage. 
*Latency is a tax on reality. Letâ€™s eliminate it.*

## My Operating Model: Own Deep R&D private projects + High-quality external projects Consulting

I run long-horizon R&D â€” in infrastructure, trading systems, and performance engineering.  
To fund it, I consult with a small set of top-tier teams where architecture truly matters.  
In trading, I have full skin in the game: with my own capital and no external funding.
  
If you're building an infrastructure-level system â€” one that must survive failure, evolve over years, and perform near hardware limits â€”  
and you're looking for someone who can find **competitive advantage** (with bare-metal: optional), let's talk.

## My Hall Of Fame

**[Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/korzhenevski/korzhenevski/blob/master/RecEngine.md) for TikTok-like social app (2023)**
> Serve **10K RPS** with `p99 < 20â€¯ms` on bare-metal.
> SIMD HNSW + Roaring Bitmaps in **C++/Go**
> Deployed early on **Graviton** (ARM Instances, 2Ã— cost efficiency). Now: ARM = industry norm.
> Result: **p99 < 15â€¯ms sustained**.

**Blockchain Validator Node for leading Altcoin Mining Pool (2022)**
> Accelerate a black-box PoW node (no docs, limited source-code).
> Reverse-engineered gossip layer. Custom booster in **Go/C++**. Optimization with PGO + AVX2.
> Result: **+16% validator reward**, no protocol changes.

**HFT Market Data Lake for 20+ quants trading firm (2019)**
> Query a 50â€¯TB / 500B-row market data lake in real time (was 60s+).
> Pre-mainstream **ClickHouse** design: schema, cluster, OS tuning. Now: Clickhouse = industry standard.
> Result: **<50â€¯ms** latency â€” **1200Ã— faster**. 

**[Distributed Financial DB](https://github.com/korzhenevski/korzhenevski/blob/master/AsgardDB.md) for NASDAQ-traded fintech company (2017)**
> Survive a full datacenter failure in a geo-distributed financial processor.
> Co-designed with 1 other engineer. Built on ePaxos + RAMCloud principles.
> Passed **Jepsen** â€” the world's toughest test for distributed systems.

**Security Scanner for Yandex Global Infra (2015)**
> Built in 4 months, scanning **50K+ servers 24/7** â€” even during DC failures.
> Deployed across 3 datacenters, deeply integrated with internal infra.
> **Saved $1M+ vs commercial solution.** Still in use.

## Engineering Journey: 17 Years of Strategic Bets Over Hype

**2024â€“Now** â€” *Quant Trading R&D* `1ms.tech`  
> Synthesizing 15+ years of systems experience into market-structure-aware alpha generation.  
> Goal: make chaotic L2/L3 order flow legible, tradable, and architecturally sound.

**2022â€“2023** â€” *Bare-Metal Control*  
> Built in a C dialect with near 1:1 instruction mapping.  
> Outperformed idiomatic C++ by **60â€“80%** on critical paths.

**2018â€“2021** â€” *Full-System Depth*  
> Deep **C++**, modern **Bazel**, binary-level tuning.  
> Cross-stack fluency: **iOS** (Swift, Obj-C), **Flutter** (Dart) â€” to build **systems**, not just services.

**2015â€“2018** â€” *Cloud-Native, Early*  
> Kubernetes across multiple datacenters â€” before it was popular.  
> High-concurrency async Python (Django, Flask) â€” before `async` was mainstream.

**2014** â€” *The Go Bet*  
> Adopted **Golang** early. Built high-load infra using core concurrency primitives.

**2012â€“2013** â€” *The Modern Web, Before It Was a Thing*  
> Production Angular.js SPAs and MongoDB â€” pre-MEAN era.  
> Strategic bet on JSON-native infra while others clung to LAMP-stack.

**2011â€“2012** â€” *High-Concurrency Groundwork*  
> Real-time platforms in **Erlang** + **Ruby**.  
> Dev/Prod parity with **Vagrant** â€” 4 years before Docker.

**2008â€“2010** â€” *APIs, CDNs & Schema Dynamics*  
> Dynamic-schema API (pre-GraphQL) for VoD platform.  
> Built **10 Gbps video CDN** â€” extreme scale for the time.
